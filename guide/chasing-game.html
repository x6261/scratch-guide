            <h2>Make a new project</h2>
            <p>The “forever” block in the Control tab repeats any code inside it until the project stops. Forever loops 
                are necessary in most games because they keep essential actions running at all times—such as moving 
                characters, updating health or score, checking for collisions, playing animations, and responding to 
                player input. Without a forever loop, these continuous game behaviors wouldn’t function properly.
            </p>
            <p>Also in the Control tab, you’ll find the “if () then” block, which is called a conditional. It runs the 
                code inside only when the condition in the hexagon-shaped slot is true. Conditionals are essential for 
                decision-making in games, such as checking whether a key is pressed, an enemy is touched, or a score 
                reaches a certain value.
            </p>

            <p>Begin by creating a sprite that will serve as your main character. It can be anything you like, but we’ll 
                use the Parrot sprite. After choosing your sprite, rename it to “Player.” 
            </p>
            <p>Inside your “Player” sprite, add the code shown below. These blocks control how your character moves 
                across the screen. Notice that the values you use in the change x by an d change y by blocks determine 
                how fast the Player moves. Try experimenting with different numbers or adjusting the layout of your 
                movement code to customize the feel of your character’s controls. This is a great way to make the 
                movement match the style of your game.
            </p>

            <p>After making the main character, let's go ahead and make the objects that the "Player" will chase. Let's 
                make a new sprite, or you can choose your own. In this sprite, you will copy the following code inside. 
            </p>
            <img src="/imgs/butterfly_code.png" alt="butterfly_code">
            <p>If you want to make the game more challenging, right-click the sprite that is being chased and select 
                Duplicate. This creates an identical copy of that sprite. You can repeat this process as many times as 
                you like to increase the difficulty. After adding the extra sprites, test your game and adjust their 
                behavior or speed to match the level of challenge you want.
