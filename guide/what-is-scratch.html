            <h1>What is Scratch?</h1>
            <h2>About Scratch</h2>
            <p>Scratch is a free, block-based programming language and online community developed by the MIT Media Lab.
                Designed for beginners and young learners, it allows users to create interactive stories, games, and
                animations using a simple drag-and-drop interface. By snapping together color-coded blocks, users can
                build programs without writing code, making it an engaging introduction to programming.

            <h2>Scratch History</h2>
            <p>Launched in 2007, Scratch emphasizes learning through creation. Its interface features a stage for visual
                output, sprites for characters, and categorized blocks for motion, looks, sound, and control. As users
                design projects, they explore key programming concepts like sequences, loops, conditionals, and
                variables.
                A standout feature is Scratch’s global online community, where millions share projects, give feedback,
                and remix others’ work.
            </p>
            <h2>Why Choose Scratch?</h2>
            <p>The platform’s motto <b>“Imagine, Program, Share”</b> captures its spirit of exploration and sharing.
                Scratch lays a strong foundation for transitioning to text-based languages like Python or JavaScript.
                With
                its accessibility and creative potential, Scratch remains one of the most effective tools for learning
                to code as a beginner.
